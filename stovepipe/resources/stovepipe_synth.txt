<h1>What is a synth?</h1>
                    <p>A synthesizer is an electronic musical instrument that generates sound that can be 
                        manipulated using various methods of producing and merging frequencies. The capabilities 
                        of synthesizers are far beyond the scope and flexibility of the sounds traditional analog 
                        instruments can generate. An elaborate design of wires, integrated circuits, resistors, 
                        capacitors, etc. are the elements of signal processing for these machines. Developing the 
                        frequency, velocity, amplification, duration and timbre is entirely up to the imagination 
                        and knowledge of an individual using the device.</p>
                <h1>Basic Signal Processing of Synthesizers</h1>
                    <p>The three major modules that are subjectively essential for a synthesizer are an oscillator,  
                        filter and amplifier. This <i>'signal flow'</i> between an oscillator to afilter,then to 
                        an amplifier, is how the sound is processed and heard. Other components can be used to shape 
                        or modulate the sound, but without these three mentioned <i>in this order</i>, the 
                        capabilities of the machine are limited and possibly unable to function.<br><br><b> 
                        Oscillators are the modules that output a voltage (signal) which fluctuates a 
                        straightforward repeating pattern.</b> These patterns are called waveforms and there are 
                        four basic waveforms. Each waveform creates a different shape with certain types of harmonic 
                        content. The most basic waveform is a sine wave. It is a single frequency only and when set 
                        at default tuning it generates the first harmonic, also known as the fundamental. A triangle 
                        wave contains only odd integer harmonicsdescending in volume exponentially. A sawtooth wave 
                        contains all integer harmonics descending in volume linearly. These waveforms tend to emulate 
                        string and brass instruments. Asquare and/or pulse wave contains only odd integer harmonics 
                        descending in volume linearly. These can be used to reproduce woodwind instruments. Most 
                        synthesizers have the choice of using a more complicated waveform that can be generated by 
                        an oscillator called noise. This waveform has a harmonic content which all frequencies are 
                        at equal amplitude. It is useful for producing snare drums, gunshots, wind, and other 
                        special effect sounds. <br><br><b>Filters are modules that are used to change the timbre or 
                        tone quality of the waveform.</b> These filters scoop out frequencies in the harmonic 
                        content in order to shape the sound that is heard. Different basic forms of filtering that 
                        are used to create what is known as subtractive synthesis. Cutoff frequency filtering is the 
                        frequency at which the filter begins attenuating. Low pass filtering will allow all 
                        frequencies below the cutoff frequency to go by while attenuating all frequencies above the 
                        cutoff frequency. High pass filtering is the opposite, allowing all frequencies above the 
                        cutoff to be heard while attenuating frequencies below the cutoff. Band pass filtering lets 
                        a range of frequencies centered at the cutoff frequency get through while attenuating all 
                        frequencies outside of that range. Notch filtering (also known as band reject) attenuates a 
                        range of frequencies while passing all frequencies outside that range. Resonance filtering 
                        can create an increase in amplitude at the cutoff frequency. This can only be used to 
                        increase frequencies that are present in the harmonic content of the waveform. 
                        <br><br><b>Amplifiers are modules that control the volume of a soundwave.</b> These devices 
                        can be voltage controlled (VCA) or digitally controlled (DCA). VCA and DCA modules are 
                        primarily designed to control the intensity of audio signals. These devices articulate 
                        whether a sound is intensified or attenuated.<br><br><b>Examples of different modules used 
                        for modulation are envelope generators, LFOs, and effects processors.</b> Modulation is 
                        the technique of shaping the tone using control signals. The signal for modulation can be 
                        routed  several ways. One module can influence one or multiple other modules. Sometimes it 
                        can be from one note to the next or while a single note is being played. Dynamic shape, 
                        gradual changes in timbre, and wavering of pitch can all be dictated by modulation.
