Just prior to NAMM 2016, the Korg Minilogue synthesizer designed by Tatsuya Takahashi was announced. And it instantly became a smash hit.  Due to its affordability and intrinsically easy design, it became powerhouse from the get-go. Ladies and gentlemen, I can not express my love for this machine without telling you a short bit about my past. 
I have played guitar in bands for 20 plus years now and dabbled with synthesizers and plug-ins along the way. But my obsession began when I took an introductory synth class at Austin Community College in 2017, taught by Francis Preve. I asked him which synth he would recommend for a beginner and the rest is history. 
The best way to learn how to do sound design with the Minilogue is to understand what we got under the hood. It is a two VCO per-voice, four-voice, polyphonic analog engine. Each VCO has an octave switch [16’, 8’, 4’, 2’] and a Waves switch between square, triangle and sawtooth. Behind those are a Pitch knob to fine tune using one-cent steps and a Shape knob to determine the complexity of the waveform. Then the signal goes to a Cross Mod Depth knob can allow Oscillator 1 to modulate the pitch of Oscillator 2. The Pitch EG (Envelope Generator) can also be used to change the Pitch of Oscillator 2. The Sync switch takes the phase of oscillator 2 and forcibly synchronized to the phase of oscillator 1. This feature is great for generating popular leads. With the Ring Modulation switch, the output of the sum and difference of the frequencies from the two oscillators create non-tonal and metallic sounds by adjusting the pitch. The range of sounds from this point are exhausting and we haven’t even got to the filter yet!
